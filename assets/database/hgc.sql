Facebook plans for a band built on that tech is wrist-based and can sense individual motor neurons, according to the company. It can convert finger motions and even small squeezes and shifts into actions that animate a virtual hand. It looks like what hand tracking already does inthe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tags/oculus/\">Oculus</a>&nbsp;Quest VR headset, but in this case it can work without moving your fingers at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s where things could get really strange and fascinating. Facebook&#39;s shown aspects of its neural input tech before, and demos of how finger-typing on a desk could eventually adapt into a custom keyboard that learns and improves, almost like how phone-based touch and swipe keyboards do. But the tech could work even without moving any fingers at all. Or, without having fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tech like this does exist elsewhere: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/controlling-vr-with-my-mind-nextminds-dev-kit-shows-me-a-strange-new-world/\">Mudra Band</a>, a neural input band being made for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-watch-series-3-review/\">Apple Watch</a>&nbsp;this year, similarly senses finger movements and small gestures. Other companies may also have other solutions, but Facebook&#39;s work looks like some of the most advanced seen so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&#39;s ambitions in assistive technology are clear, after showing a demo of how the input bands could be used with virtual finger motions even when a hand is missing fingers. Another demo where someone makes a computer dinosaur jump by pressing a spacebar is then shown being done by the wristband&#39;s motor neuron measurements, with the hand seemingly not moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent podcast conversation with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-talks-the-future-of-ar-and-vr-in-the-informations-reality-check\" target=\"_blank\">The Information</a>, Facebook CEO&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tags/mark-zuckerberg/\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>&nbsp;discussed the idea of having extra virtual hands. Facebook Reality Labs&#39; team also invokes this idea, which is brain-boggling. Even more so, there&#39;s the question of how these phantom or extra limbs or digits would work with AR glasses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the immediate future, Facebook is more focused on specific actions that the band can recognize, the main one being a small finger-press called Intelligent Click. The small actions are meant to accompany heads-up displays that could proactively suggest information (buying something, directions or cooking directions while cooking) that you could click to accept or refuse. The band also looks like it recognizes individual finger movements, thumb movements, squeezes and drawing on your hand like a trackpad. It looks like a potentially more precise way to control AR headsets:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tags/microsoft/\">Microsoft&#39;s</a>&nbsp;HoloLens 2 has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/hands-on-at-home-with-microsofts-hololens-2/\">no controller at all</a>, and hand gestures can sometimes be difficult to pull off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someday, Facebook&#39;s research science director Sean Keller says, you&#39;ll enter a cafe donning AR glasses and a wristband. Then a digital assistant will ask if you want to order an Americano. An interface will appear that you&#39;ll see floating in front of you, like a notification on your phone or the voice on your smart speaker. But to tell it what you want, you won&#39;t speak or touch a screen. You&#39;ll tap your fingers together in the air, and a neural-input wristband will recognize your subtle smart click.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wrist squeezes, haptic emoji</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"click\" src=\"https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/zDjJzMAMB3x6rBbBmPiC-G6Rp-4=/1092x0/2021/03/17/42b28d2f-97f3-4b50-affb-b0ed1ca70d14/click.jpg\" style=\"height:0px; width:1092px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook has been working on a way to control a machine by clicking your fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook&#39;s been exploring haptic, vibrational feedback wearables for four years, according to Nicholas Colonnese, manager for research science at Facebook Reality Labs. At least a dozen prototypes in the Reality Labs&#39; research division hint at what feedback will be worked into a future band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One, an inflatable wrist-cuff called the Bellowband, shown off during a video chat presentation, has eight blood pressure cuff-like inflatable zones that squeeze the wrist. A more developed Tasbi (Tactile and Squeeze Bracelet Interface) band also vibrates (with &quot;six vibrotactile actuators&quot;) and squeezes. Facebook&#39;s demo videos show people wearing one band on each wrist, playing virtual games like tennis and archery, where the bands can give haptic feedback that feels realistic enough to make the floating objects feel tactile. Facebook says the tech works convincingly, even without wearing anything on the fingertips, via a cognitive phenomenon called sensory substitution (similar to how prosthetic devices can be operated).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"emg-interaction\" src=\"https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/HuZVEm4d7ndEHRleqvATKb03oNk=/1092x0/2021/03/18/a8166db6-7ef3-4f7e-8834-19bc49b6b3a6/emg-interaction.jpg\" style=\"height:0px; width:1092px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example of thumb navigation while wearing the prototype neural wristband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook is exploring &quot;haptic emoji&quot; for these bands, which would send custom vibrations or squeezes, Colonnese says. It sounds like Apple&#39;s early exploration of sending&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/apple-watch-digital-touch-feature/\">&quot;digital touches&quot;</a>&nbsp;via the Apple Watch. Another use could be subtle pings to navigate while walking, which is also used on some wearables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook&#39;s current&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/reviews/oculus-touch-preview/\">Oculus Touch</a>&nbsp;controllers have only basic vibrating feedback, but these haptics look far more advanced. Recent advanced haptics devices, from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/apple/\">Apple&#39;s</a>&nbsp;subtle Apple Watch pings to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tags/sony/\">Sony&#39;s</a>&nbsp;force-feedback adaptive trigger-equipped&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/sonys-ps5-controller-is-the-most-magical-part-of-the-next-gen-console/\">DualSense PS5 controller</a>, show what Facebook could be aiming for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"haptic-bow-arrow\" src=\"https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/aQyMEt3NDA8GnteUD7w58gl-LAY=/1092x0/2021/03/18/f645145b-809c-4a9a-8b2e-c6e864b81665/haptic-bow-arrow.jpg\" style=\"height:0px; width:1092px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook&#39;s vision for haptic-feedback virtual archery sounds like it could work as well in VR as AR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Could this come to VR before AR, and what about smartwatches and smart homes?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The wristband and haptics seem like the sort of evolution Facebook could adopt for VR beyond the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/reviews/oculus-quest-review/\">Oculus Quest</a>. Facebook acknowledges that VR is part of how the company&#39;s been prototyping its neural interfaces but told CNET that, while nothing is planned imminently, there could be possibilities similar to the Quest&#39;s hand tracking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As you saw with hand tracking, as the technology gets good enough for a consumer to use and is easy to learn, we get to start thinking about how it can fit into a consumer product,&quot; a Facebook spokesperson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could this also work on a future Facebook watch in combination with ambient&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/smart-home/\">smart home</a>&nbsp;tech and not require a headset at all? Maybe, but not right away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This technology could take a lot of forms and cover a lot of use cases, but right now we&#39;re currently focused on how the tech we are building can work together (AR glasses + wristband),&quot; a Facebook spokesperson told CNET via email. &quot;Wristband wearables may offer a path to ultra-low-friction, always-available input for AR glasses, but they&#39;re not a complete solution on their own -- just as the mouse is one piece of the graphical user interface. They need to be assisted with intent prediction and user modeling that adapts to you and your particular context in real time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"frl-research-ar\" src=\"https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/9Awdw-dqKL7jCU6hKGG5IR9HuSk=/1092x0/2021/03/18/64f289f2-092c-41ed-9d54-d3428c4e4928/frl-research-ar.jpg\" style=\"height:0px; width:1092px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How Facebook&#39;s new AR inputs will handle data privacy is still a mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Collecting more intimate data</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The future that Facebook envisions where people are able to type, order a coffee or look up a recipe without picking up their smartphone or opening a computer also involves collecting a trove of personal data from people and their surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Privacy advocates have raised concerns that the technology could be used by governments or law enforcement agencies for constant surveillance. The social network has also been looking at whether to add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-weighs-whether-to-build-facial-recognition-into-smart-glasses/\">facial recognition</a>&nbsp;to its smart glasses, and the company&#39;s own employees have brought up potential harms such as the abuse of the technology by stalkers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kurt Opsahl, deputy executive director and general counsel of EFF, said there&#39;s an extra layer of privacy concerns given how much personal data Facebook already collects about its users to serve targeted ads.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One of the concerns that has come up time and time again over the years is the possibility that Facebook would use that data for a new purpose that [users] didn&#39;t agree to when they originally gave the information to Facebook,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The social network has had a poor track record of safeguarding user privacy and has faced more scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators since the Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018. Cambridge Analytica, a UK consulting firm hired by former President Donald Trump&#39;s 2016 election campaign, harvested the data from up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent as part of an effort to influence the behavior of American voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook hasn&#39;t provided a lot of details about how it plans to use the data gathered from AR glasses in the future, including whether it will be used to serve people even more targeted advertising. It&#39;s unclear if Facebook plans to link data gathered from its smart glasses to a person&#39;s Facebook profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If aspects of this research are applied to consumer devices in the future, we will be up front about any plans related to ads,&quot; a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook executives have acknowledged that the neural data they&#39;re collecting as part ofthe research is highly personal. Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer, though, noted the information collected to decipher a person&#39;s intent to move their hand is &quot;nowhere near&quot; collecting information about people&#39;s thoughts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company also said it&#39;s sharing its research so people can weigh in with their own concerns about the technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The reality is that we can&#39;t anticipate or solve all the ethical issues associated with this technology on our own,&quot; Keller said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/topics/sci-tech/\">Sc</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'facebook-wrist-band-2-963765-1616143536.jpg', 'how-facebook-plans-to-blend-the-virtual-and-real-with-your-wrist', '2021-03-19 11:47:10', 1),

In mid-January, Samsung introduced its new flagship phone lineup --&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-5g-phone-pretty-badass/\">Galaxy S21, S21 Plus and S21 Ultra</a>&nbsp;-- during its first virtual Unpacked of the year.

At the same time, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/health/covid-19-vaccine-details-new-variants-when-you-can-get-vaccinated-hidden-fees/\">pandemic</a>&nbsp;has hurt millions of people financially.

They ranged from $110 for the Galaxy A10 to $650 for the Galaxy A71 5G on Verizon&#39;s network (<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-600-5g-galaxy-phone-launches/\">it&#39;s $600 at other carriers</a>&nbsp;without super-fast 5G millimeter-wave connectivity). All came with some high-end features, though they weren&#39;t nearly as premium as the specs found in the Galaxy S, Note and foldables. And none came close to the price tag for Samsung&#39;s premium phones, which started at $1,000 for the Galaxy S20.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Samsung introduced three new models, the 6.5-inch Galaxy A52 and A52 5G and the 6.7-inch Galaxy A72. Right now, only one model, the A52 5G, can connect to 5G networks, and at least initially, the device only works on the slower but more reliable sub-6GHz. Samsung has two other A family 5G models that it previously announced, the A32 5G and the A42 5G.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy A52 phones in white, violet, blue and black.\" src=\"https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/QkXUQ5HMpIc52VEEDRUfEFo4tPw=/1092x0/2021/03/16/fd4782af-2ddf-4952-989c-e8d833c6c1ea/30-galaxya52-white-violet-blue-black-210310002027.jpg\" style=\"height:0px; width:1092px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung&#39;s Galaxy A52 comes in four color options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While each market is in a different stage of its 5G journey, we are committed to rolling out 5G-ready devices so users can have tomorrow&#39;s technology today and reap the benefits of 5G as soon as it rolls out in their region, be that next week, next month or next year,&quot; KJ Kim, head of Samsung&#39;s mobile R&amp;D office, said in an FAQ ahead of the event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that providing software updates for longer periods will allow consumers to hold onto their devices longer than before. The new A family will receive three generations of Android OS updates and at least four years of security updates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three new phones have big batteries, with the A52 models sporting 4,500-mAh batteries and the A72 packing in a 5,000-mAh battery. By comparison, the Galaxy S21 includes a 4,000-mAh battery, while the S21 Ultra has a 5,000-mAh battery. The A52, A52 5G and A72 come with 25-watt fast charging and come with an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three have a 32-megapixel front-facing camera and four rear-facing cameras, including 64-megapixel main lenses, 12-megapixel ultrawide lenses and 5-megapixel macro lenses. The A52 models also have 5-megapixel depth cameras and have digital zoom up to 10x, while the A72 has an 8-megapixel telephoto lens capable of digital zoom up to 30x and optical zoom at 3x.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"01-galaxya72-lifestyle-violet-210309110222\" src=\"https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/36FJhFOBe1BwQx8p_9BJPYhcLm4=/1092x0/2021/03/16/33a0ebd5-8fff-4174-a57c-f8754783a268/01-galaxya72-lifestyle-violet-210309110222.jpg\" style=\"height:0px; width:1092px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung&#39;s Galaxy A52 comes with a 4G version or a 5G model.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4K Video Snap lets users capture an 8-megapixel image from 4K video, while Scene Optimizer recognizes 30 different scenes -- such as outdoor landscapes, pets and food -- and automatically adjusts the camera settings for the best shots. The phones come with Night Mode to capture better photos in low-light situations, and they feature some pro video features. Users can set up their own photo filters with My Filter,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/galaxy-s9-ar-emoji-what-you-need-to-know/\">customize their own AR Emoji</a>&nbsp;and apply AR lenses from Snapchat with Fund Mode right from the native camera app.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The A52 and A52 5G have 6.5-inch FHD Plus Super AMOLED Infinity-O displays, and the 5G version has a 120Hz refresh rate. The regular A52 and A72 screens have 90Hz refresh rates, and all three have Samsung&#39;s Eye Comfort Shield that automatically adjusts the blue light emitted by the phones based on the time of day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three devices have new stereo speakers that can increase volume up to 43% from older models. They&#39;re available in Awesome Violet, Awesome Blue, Awesome Black and Awesome White. And they all come with the charging brick in the box, something Samsung has moved away from in its flagship phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For many users, the Galaxy A series is their first Galaxy smartphone, and may not have the full ecosystem of Galaxy accessories at their fingertips,&quot; Woncheol Chai, senior vice president and head of the experience planning team in Samsung&#39;s mobile communications business, said in an FAQ provided to reporters ahead of the event. Samsung isn&#39;t including headphones in the box with its new A series phones, and Chai hinted that future phones in the A Series may not come with chargers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Samsung is working on the global transition of the removal of the charger plug and earphones from Galaxy smartphones,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n', '01-galaxya72-lifestyle-violet-210309110222.jpg', 'samsungs-latest-galaxy-a-phones-embrace-features-we-miss-at-a-lower-cost', '2021-03-19 11:52:53', 2),

(26, 'Facebook plans to blend the virtual and real with your wrist', '<p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tags/facebook/\">Facebook</a>, a social network that has already changed the way people communicate, has set its sights on another lofty goal: seamlessly blending digital life with the physical world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big part of that future will involve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facebooks-ready-to-talk-about-how-its-ar-glasses-will-work-with-neural-wristbands/\">wrist-based technology</a>&nbsp;that can sense your neural signals and track your intentions, even without your moving. It sounds like a band that can give you Star Wars-like Force powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explain how this could work, Facebook&#39;s research science manager Tanya Jonker describes the process of cooking a zucchini herb omelette with a friend. Currently, people might have to interrupt a conversation to set a timer on their smartphone. In the future, through augmented reality, people will be able to complete this task by simply moving their finger.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A wristband that senses your fingers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, Facebook acquired neural input tech company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-buys-ctrl-labs-to-work-on-a-wristband-that-will-let-you-control-computers-with-your-mind/\">CTRL-Labs</a>, which developed an armband to sense neural signals. Facebook plans for a band built on that tech is wrist-based and can sense individual motor neurons, according to the company. It can convert finger motions and even small squeezes and shifts into actions that animate a virtual hand. It looks like what hand tracking already does inthe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tags/oculus/\">Oculus</a>&nbsp;Quest VR headset, but in this case it can work without moving your fingers at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s where things could get really strange and fascinating. Facebook&#39;s shown aspects of its neural input tech before, and demos of how finger-typing on a desk could eventually adapt into a custom keyboard that learns and improves, almost like how phone-based touch and swipe keyboards do. But the tech could work even without moving any fingers at all. Or, without having fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tech like this does exist elsewhere: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/controlling-vr-with-my-mind-nextminds-dev-kit-shows-me-a-strange-new-world/\">Mudra Band</a>, a neural input band being made for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/reviews/apple-watch-series-3-review/\">Apple Watch</a>&nbsp;this year, similarly senses finger movements and small gestures. Other companies may also have other solutions, but Facebook&#39;s work looks like some of the most advanced seen so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&#39;s ambitions in assistive technology are clear, after showing a demo of how the input bands could be used with virtual finger motions even when a hand is missing fingers. Another demo where someone makes a computer dinosaur jump by pressing a spacebar is then shown being done by the wristband&#39;s motor neuron measurements, with the hand seemingly not moving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent podcast conversation with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-talks-the-future-of-ar-and-vr-in-the-informations-reality-check\" target=\"_blank\">The Information</a>, Facebook CEO&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tags/mark-zuckerberg/\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>&nbsp;discussed the idea of having extra virtual hands. Facebook Reality Labs&#39; team also invokes this idea, which is brain-boggling. Even more so, there&#39;s the question of how these phantom or extra limbs or digits would work with AR glasses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the immediate future, Facebook is more focused on specific actions that the band can recognize, the main one being a small finger-press called Intelligent Click. The small actions are meant to accompany heads-up displays that could proactively suggest information (buying something, directions or cooking directions while cooking) that you could click to accept or refuse. The band also looks like it recognizes individual finger movements, thumb movements, squeezes and drawing on your hand like a trackpad. It looks like a potentially more precise way to control AR headsets:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tags/microsoft/\">Microsoft&#39;s</a>&nbsp;HoloLens 2 has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/hands-on-at-home-with-microsofts-hololens-2/\">no controller at all</a>, and hand gestures can sometimes be difficult to pull off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someday, Facebook&#39;s research science director Sean Keller says, you&#39;ll enter a cafe donning AR glasses and a wristband. Then a digital assistant will ask if you want to order an Americano. An interface will appear that you&#39;ll see floating in front of you, like a notification on your phone or the voice on your smart speaker. But to tell it what you want, you won&#39;t speak or touch a screen. You&#39;ll tap your fingers together in the air, and a neural-input wristband will recognize your subtle smart click.</p>\r\n', '03GhbriKWDYnw2630CHhOwv-1_1616086391_fit_lim.jpg', 'facebook-plans-to-blend-the-virtual-and-real-with-your-wrist', '2021-03-19 12:28:35', 5);

The new devices boast some higher-end specs but cost less than their Galaxy S siblings, something that will likely make them attractive to a wide range of buyers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared with the Galaxy S21 lineup, the new Galaxy A series phones all come with features dropped from the company&#39;s high-end devices that many consumers love: headphone jacks, MicroSD card slots to expand the memory up to 1TB and chargers in the box. They also tout two-day battery life, four camera lenses on the back and Super AMOLED screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the biggest selling point for the phones is the price. Internationally, the Galaxy A52 costs 349 euros (approximately $415, AU$540), the A52 5G retails for 429 euros ($510, AU$660) and the A72 is 449 euros ($534, AU$690). The devices are available in some markets Wednesday, though Samsung didn&#39;t detail which ones and it hasn&#39;t yet provided US pricing.

The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-5g-phone-pretty-badass/\">Galaxy S21</a>, unveiled in January, starts at $800.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a competitive price point considering the amount of tech they have,&quot; Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi said. And for the cost, consumers are getting the bells and whistles they really need. This &quot;is not a compromised experience,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung showed off the new A family&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-sets-march-17-for-its-second-unpacked-event-of-2021/\">on Wednesday during a virtual Unpacked launch</a>, an event previously reserved for its highest-end and most important devices. In mid-January, Samsung introduced its new flagship phone lineup --&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-5g-phone-pretty-badass/\">Galaxy S21, S21 Plus and S21 Ultra</a>&nbsp;-- during its first virtual Unpacked of the year. This time around, Samsung dubbed its event the Galaxy Awesome Unpacked to explain how it&#39;s &quot;bringing Awesome to everyone&quot; with its new Galaxy A devices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung&#39;s bigger push with the A series this year reflects the reality we&#39;re all living in. Phone designs aren&#39;t changing much from year to year, and consumers are holding onto devices for longer, about three years in the US versus two in the past. At the same time, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/health/covid-19-vaccine-details-new-variants-when-you-can-get-vaccinated-hidden-fees/\">pandemic</a>&nbsp;has hurt millions of people financially.

In the US, where there&#39;s often a bigger market for pricey phones than in many other regions, the A family&#39;s shipments surpassed those of the S lineup, 26% to 19%, Strategy Analytics said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Galaxy A series is designed to make Samsung&#39;s latest cutting-edge product more accessible to a wider audience than ever before,&quot; TM Roh, the head of Samsung&#39;s mobile business, said in an FAQ provided to reporters ahead of the event. &quot;Price point shouldn&#39;t be a limiting factor when choosing technology.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To that end, Samsung in January&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21s-standout-feature-is-its-200-price-cut/\">lowered the starting cost for its Galaxy S21 devices by $200 to $800</a>&nbsp;from last year&#39;s S20 family, partly because of lower component costs and partly as a recognition of the fact the world is battling a pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get a look at Samsung&#39;s new Galaxy A52, A52 5G, A72 phones</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/pictures/get-a-look-at-samsungs-new-galaxy-a52-a52-5g-a72-phones/\">&nbsp;See all photos</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/pictures/get-a-look-at-samsungs-new-galaxy-a52-a52-5g-a72-phones/\"><img alt=\"Galaxy A52 and A72 phones in white, black, and violet\" src=\"https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/H0lT3BBIz10xKasVLGpOzqwo3lg=/532x299/2021/03/16/0cdfb87f-6d1b-4572-8453-07b680ef4028/39-galaxya32-a52-a72-white-black-violet-210309234128.jpg\" style=\"height:299px; width:532px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/pictures/get-a-look-at-samsungs-new-galaxy-a52-a52-5g-a72-phones/\"><img alt=\"12-galaxya72-handson-white-210310014501\" src=\"https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/qFFqQej7EEiVmB659Mws_gK6A7A=/532x299/2021/03/16/269e0491-99d7-4d33-a893-cecc4a2b7048/12-galaxya72-handson-white-210310014501.jpg\" style=\"height:299px; width:532px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/pictures/get-a-look-at-samsungs-new-galaxy-a52-a52-5g-a72-phones/\"><img alt=\"01-galaxya72-lifestyle-violet-210309110222\" src=\"https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/UG2vpnJTaGIApsq1oniMNf4O0v8=/532x299/2021/03/16/33a0ebd5-8fff-4174-a57c-f8754783a268/01-galaxya72-lifestyle-violet-210309110222.jpg\" style=\"height:299px; width:532px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/pictures/get-a-look-at-samsungs-new-galaxy-a52-a52-5g-a72-phones/\">+11 More</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>All of A&#39;s specs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year&#39;s Galaxy A lineup included four 4G LTE phones and two 5G models. They ranged from $110 for the Galaxy A10 to $650 for the Galaxy A71 5G on Verizon&#39;s network (<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-600-5g-galaxy-phone-launches/\">it&#39;s $600 at other carriers</a>&nbsp;without super-fast 5G millimeter-wave connectivity). All came with some high-end features, though they weren&#39;t nearly as premium as the specs found in the Galaxy S, Note and foldables. And none came close to the price tag for Samsung&#39;s premium phones, which started at $1,000 for the Galaxy S20.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Samsung introduced three new models, the 6.5-inch Galaxy A52 and A52 5G and the 6.7-inch Galaxy A72. Right now, only one model, the A52 5G, can connect to 5G networks, and at least initially, the device only works on the slower but more reliable sub-6GHz. Samsung has two other A family 5G models that it previously announced, the A32 5G and the A42 5G.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy A52 phones in white, violet, blue and black.\" src=\"https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/QkXUQ5HMpIc52VEEDRUfEFo4tPw=/1092x0/2021/03/16/fd4782af-2ddf-4952-989c-e8d833c6c1ea/30-galaxya52-white-violet-blue-black-210310002027.jpg\" style=\"height:0px; width:1092px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung&#39;s Galaxy A52 comes in four color options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While each market is in a different stage of its 5G journey, we are committed to rolling out 5G-ready devices so users can have tomorrow&#39;s technology today and reap the benefits of 5G as soon as it rolls out in their region, be that next week, next month or next year,&quot; KJ Kim, head of Samsung&#39;s mobile R&amp;D office, said in an FAQ ahead of the event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that providing software updates for longer periods will allow consumers to hold onto their devices longer than before. The new A family will receive three generations of Android OS updates and at least four years of security updates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three new phones have big batteries, with the A52 models sporting 4,500-mAh batteries and the A72 packing in a 5,000-mAh battery. By comparison, the Galaxy S21 includes a 4,000-mAh battery, while the S21 Ultra has a 5,000-mAh battery. The A52, A52 5G and A72 come with 25-watt fast charging and come with an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three have a 32-megapixel front-facing camera and four rear-facing cameras, including 64-megapixel main lenses, 12-megapixel ultrawide lenses and 5-megapixel macro lenses. The A52 models also have 5-megapixel depth cameras and have digital zoom up to 10x, while the A72 has an 8-megapixel telephoto lens capable of digital zoom up to 30x and optical zoom at 3x.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"01-galaxya72-lifestyle-violet-210309110222\" src=\"https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/36FJhFOBe1BwQx8p_9BJPYhcLm4=/1092x0/2021/03/16/33a0ebd5-8fff-4174-a57c-f8754783a268/01-galaxya72-lifestyle-violet-210309110222.jpg\" style=\"height:0px; width:1092px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung&#39;s Galaxy A52 comes with a 4G version or a 5G model.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4K Video Snap lets users capture an 8-megapixel image from 4K video, while Scene Optimizer recognizes 30 different scenes -- such as outdoor landscapes, pets and food -- and automatically adjusts the camera settings for the best shots. The phones come with Night Mode to capture better photos in low-light situations, and they feature some pro video features. Users can set up their own photo filters with My Filter,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/galaxy-s9-ar-emoji-what-you-need-to-know/\">customize their own AR Emoji</a>&nbsp;and apply AR lenses from Snapchat with Fund Mode right from the native camera app.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The A52 and A52 5G have 6.5-inch FHD Plus Super AMOLED Infinity-O displays, and the 5G version has a 120Hz refresh rate. The regular A52 and A72 screens have 90Hz refresh rates, and all three have Samsung&#39;s Eye Comfort Shield that automatically adjusts the blue light emitted by the phones based on the time of day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three devices have new stereo speakers that can increase volume up to 43% from older models. They&#39;re available in Awesome Violet, Awesome Blue, Awesome Black and Awesome White. And they all come with the charging brick in the box, something Samsung has moved away from in its flagship phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For many users, the Galaxy A series is their first Galaxy smartphone, and may not have the full ecosystem of Galaxy accessories at their fingertips,&quot; Woncheol Chai, senior vice president and head of the experience planning team in Samsung&#39;s mobile communications business, said in an FAQ provided to reporters ahead of the event. Samsung isn&#39;t including headphones in the box with its new A series phones, and Chai hinted that future phones in the A Series may not come with chargers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Samsung is working on the global transition of the removal of the charger plug and earphones from Galaxy smartphones,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '01-galaxya72-lifestyle-violet-210309110222.jpg', 'samsungs-latest-galaxy-a-phones-embrace-features-we-miss-at-a-lower-cost', '2021-03-19 13:07:40', 5);
